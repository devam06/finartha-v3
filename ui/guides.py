        #### Understanding Tax Slabs
        India has a progressive tax system with different tax slabs. As of the latest updates, there are two tax regimes: the **Old Regime** and the **New Regime**.

        - **Old Regime:** Allows you to claim various deductions and exemptions like HRA, Section 80C (for investments in PF, ELSS, etc.), 80D (medical insurance), and more.
        - **New Regime:** Offers lower tax rates but you must forgo most of the major deductions and exemptions.

        It's crucial to calculate your tax liability under both regimes to see which is more beneficial for you.

        #### Key Deductions (under Old Regime)
        - **Section 80C:** Up to â‚¹1.5 lakh deduction for investments in Provident Fund (PF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS), life insurance premiums, etc.
        - **Section 80D:** Deduction for health insurance premiums paid for self, family, and parents.
        - **House Rent Allowance (HRA):** If you live in a rented house, you can claim HRA exemption.

        - **Low Risk:** Public Provident Fund (PPF), Fixed Deposits (FDs), Debt Mutual Funds. Good for capital preservation.
        - **Medium Risk:** Balanced or Hybrid Mutual Funds (mix of equity and debt).
        - **High Risk:** Equity Mutual Funds, Direct Stocks. Offer potential for higher returns but come with higher risk.

        **Systematic Investment Plan (SIP):** A SIP is a great way to start investing in mutual funds. It allows you to invest a fixed amount regularly (e.g., monthly), which helps in averaging out your purchase cost and builds discipline.
